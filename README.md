This repository contains the source code for a database API. The API provides CRUD operations for managing memberships, customer details, and book records.
This API allows for efficient management of book and membership records, including the addition, retrieval, updating, and deletion of entries. It also includes Transaction Control Language (TCL) features to ensure that inventory and stock updates happen correctly, even when multiple steps are involved.
